This year’s exhibition was no longer limited to just flat-panel display (FPD) topics despite display makers such as AUO, \nInnolux, and E Ink occupying a larger space. The major exhibitions included the latest FPDs for many applications, electronic paper displays (EPDs) and their ecosystem, equipment for \npanel-level packaging (PLP), and Micro LED manufacturing equipment and materials.\n•\nEPD: E Ink demonstrated its EPD technologies, including Kaleido (4,096 colors via a color filter), Gallery, Marquee (millions of colors via CMYW pigments), Spectra (colors via color \npigments), and Prism. The Kaleido technology has been applied in many color e-readers released since 2024. E Ink and its supply chain partners demonstrated innovative applications \nand image improvements. The first foldable e-reader (8-inch) debuted at the booth. Iris Optronics featured its cholesteric LCD technology, and the performance was much better than \nin 2024.\n•"}
