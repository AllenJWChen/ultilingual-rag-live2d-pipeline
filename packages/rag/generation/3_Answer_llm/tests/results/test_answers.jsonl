The principle states that:\n\n\"...能夠生存下來的物種…並不是那些最強壯的也不是那些頭腦最聰明的而是那些能夠對環境變化做出最快反應的物種\"\n\nTranslated to English, this principle states that the species that can survive and thrive are not necessarily those that are strongest or most intelligent, but rather those that can adapt quickly to environmental changes.\n\nThis principle is mentioned in the context of discussing the impact of the US-China technological competition on Taiwan. The speaker seems to be drawing an analogy between the natural world and the global economy, suggesting that countries that can adapt quickly to changing circumstances will be more likely to succeed.\n\nAdditionally, according to Document 3 (Page 4), another key principle mentioned is the concept of \"一個世界、兩套系統\" (one world, two systems). This phrase suggests that in a rapidly changing world, different regions or countries may develop their own unique systems and approaches to technological development, rather than following a single global standard.\n\nThis idea is supported by the quote from Huawei's rotating chairman, Guo Ping, who stated in 2020 that \"一個世界兩套系統，是可能的\" (one world, two systems, is possible).\n\nOverall, these principles suggest that adaptability and flexibility are key to success in a rapidly changing global economy.", "chunks_used": ["chunk_0", "chunk_1", "chunk_2", "chunk_3", "chunk_4"], "confidence": 0.7, "lang": "en", "has_citation": true}
